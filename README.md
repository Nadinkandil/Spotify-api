# 📊 Spotify API – Postman Collections

This repository contains Postman test suites for exploring and validating various endpoints of the Spotify Web API.

---

## 🧠 Overview

These Postman collections demonstrate working with Spotify’s Web API, showcasing:

- 🎧 **Authorization flows**: obtaining and refreshing access tokens via OAuth2.
- 📁 **Playlists**: reading user playlists, adding tracks, and updating contents.
- 🔍 **Search**: retrieving tracks, artists, and albums based on search criteria.
- 🎵 **Audio features**: fetching audio statistics (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.).
- 👤 **User profile data**: accessing current user info and top artists/tracks.
- 📥 **Library management**: saving/removing tracks and albums from user’s library.

Each feature is exercised using Postman collections, with environment variables managing API credentials and token lifecycle.
